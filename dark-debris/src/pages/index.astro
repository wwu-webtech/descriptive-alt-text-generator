      <h1>Descriptive Alt Text Generator</h1>
      <h2>How It works</h2>
      <div>
				<p>Pick the method of inputting an image, either upload or link to an image (Work In Progress).</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>File Upload: </b>Click the Choose File button and select the local file you would like to evaluate</li>
					<li><b>Link To Image: </b>Input the direct link to an image on the web you would like to evaluate</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					After uploading your image, optionally prompt the AI with any 
					information to assist with its alt text generation (currently only for Gemini).
        	Press the "Evaluate Image" button, then search through the results from the different AI
        	engines for ideas as to how to best enter the alt text for your uploaded image.
          </p>
          <p>
					After receiving results (currently only with Gemini) you can expand the "Refine Results" button to include additional information for helping the AI engine rewrite the initially given alternative text, then click the "Refine" button to re-evaluate the image with the new information

      <!-- checkbox here to mark image as decorative instead of using one of the AI created suggestions To set the image as decorative. You set alt="" on the <img> element to mark an image as decorative -->
      <!-- read only edit field with code that provides the <img> tag with the preferred alt text <img href="bla bla bla" alt=""> for when it's marked as decorative, <img href="bla bla bla" alt="suggested selection from radio group above"> -->
      <!-- It might be cool to add a "Copy to Clipboard" button at the end of each result to make it simple for folks to copy the suggested alt text in case the user wants to modify it manually. -->
      <!-- Another cool feature would be to add a textbox to each result where the user could send refinement queues back to the AI result of choice to say something like "Describe the image in more detail", or something like that. -->
      <!-- The important thing to do in the UI is to ensure logical heading structure, meaningful text on all elements, and keep it simple. My suggestion is to add in some functions to complete the basics and, if you have time, jump back in and add more functionality as you see fit -->
