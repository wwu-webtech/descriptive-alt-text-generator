			<h1>Descriptive Alt Text Generator (DATG)</h1>
			<h2>Why Did We Create the DATG?</h2>
			<p>The DATG main intent, at its inception, was to help all content creators across Western Washington University create more effective alt text. We saw the need for alt text authors to have a tool that would provide suggestions for coherent and useful alt text suggestions. Please be aware that the results from the AI engines might not always be correct. Please do consider all responses from AI engines as a subjective idea rather than an objective truth. AI engines aren't necessarily always truthful. Sometimes AI engines will respond with information that isn't fully relevant. Please do verify your results.</p>
			<h2>How It works</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Pick the method of inputting an image, either upload from your local
					computer or link to an image. Linking to an image on the web is still a work in progress (WIP). 
				</p>
				<p>
<h3> Engage </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>File Upload: </b>Drag and drop a file from your device into the file area or select the 'Choose File' button to choose a file.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Link To Image: </b>Input the direct link to an image on the web
							you would like to evaluate. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
<h3> Basics</h3>
					After uploading your image, press the "Evaluate Image" button, then
					search through the results from the different AI engines (currently Gemini and ChatGPT with heading level 3's at their respective results) for ideas as
					to how to best explore the creation of interactive alt text for your uploaded image.
				</p>
				<p>
				<h2>Refine Your Results</h2>
					After receiving results you can add to the edit field of your results, and/or expand
					the "Refine Results" button below each AI engine to enter additional information. This additional information could possibly help the AI engine rewrite the initially given alternative text. Then the user should press the "Refine" button (or press the enter key while focus is in the editor)to re-evaluate the image with your new information.
