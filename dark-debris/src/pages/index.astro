			<h1>Descriptive Alt Text Generator (DATG)</h1>
			<h2>Why Did We Create the DATG?</h2>
			<p>The intent of the design of the DATG, at its inception, was to create a tool that could help all content creators across Western Washington University (WWU) create more effective and engaging alt text without a bunch of frustration during the alt text creation process. </p>
				<p>
									Please be aware that the results from these AI engines we use might not always be correct. Consider all responses from AI engines as a subjective idea rather than an objective truth. Verify your results from the AI engines before publishing results to the public.
								</p>
			<h2>How It works</h2>
				<h3>Input an Image</h3>
				<p>
					Upload an image file from your computer or link to an image. Linking to an image on the web is still a work in progress.
				</p>
				<h3> Quick Engage with the DATG</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>File Upload: </b>Drag and drop a file from your device into the file area or select the 'Choose File' button to choose a file.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Link To Image: </b>Input the direct link to an image on the web
							you would like to evaluate. This is a work in progress. We'll follow up with updates as we explore more.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
<h3>The Basics of the DATG Interface</h3>
					<p>After uploading your image, press the "Evaluate Image" button, then search through the results from the different AI engines (currently the DATG have Gemini and ChatGPT working) Hopefully this tool will help formulate ideas for alt text creations.
				</p>
				<p>
				<h2>Refine Your Results</h2>
					<p> After receiving initial results from the DATG it is possible to add additional information that will help the AI engine rewrite the initially given alternative text. Then the user can press the "Refine" button to hopefully see some changed results.</p>
