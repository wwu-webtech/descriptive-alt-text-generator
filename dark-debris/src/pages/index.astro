			<h1>Descriptive Alt Text Generator</h1>
			<h2>How It works</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Pick the method of inputting an image, either upload from your local
					computer or link to an image (Work In Progress).
				</p>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>File Upload: </b>Click the Choose File button and select the
							local file you would like to evaluate
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Link To Image: </b>Input the direct link to an image on the web
							you would like to evaluate
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
					After uploading your image, press the "Evaluate Image" button, then
					search through the results from the different AI engines for ideas as
					to how to best enter the alt text for your uploaded image.
				</p>
				<p>
					After receiving results (currently only with Gemini) you can expand
					the "Refine Results" button to include additional information for
					helping the AI engine rewrite the initially given alternative text,
					then click the "Refine" button to re-evaluate the image with the new
					information
				</p>

			<TextGenerator/>
			<!-- checkbox here to mark image as decorative instead of using one of the AI created suggestions. To set the image as decorative. You set alt="" on the <img> element -->
			<!-- If the user selects the "mark as decorative" checkbox then we verify again with the user, using a modal dialog, "Are you certain you want to mark this image as decorative?" -->
			<!-- id="AltTextOnMyImage" It would be nice to have a text field where folks could enter their alt text into, have it spell checked, and then saved into a database that correlates their image with their written alt text. -->
			<!-- It might be cool to add a "Copy to Clipboard" button where the code required to implement the adjusted alt text for id="AltTextOnMyImage" would be provided -->
