			<h2>How It works</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Pick the method of inputting an image, either upload from your local
					computer or link to an image (Work In Progress).
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>File Upload: </b>Drag and drop a file from your device into the file area or select the 'Choose File' button to choose a file.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Link To Image: </b>Input the direct link to an image on the web
							you would like to evaluate.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					After uploading your image, press the "Evaluate Image" button, then
					search through the results from the different AI engines for ideas as
					to how to best enter the alt text for your uploaded image.
				</p>
				<p>
					After receiving results (currently only with Gemini) you can expand
					the "Refine Results" button to include additional information for
					helping the AI engine rewrite the initially given alternative text,
					then click the "Refine" button to re-evaluate the image with the new
					information
				</p>
